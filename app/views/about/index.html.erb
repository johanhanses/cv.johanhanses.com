        This application is built using Ruby in rails 7, using the alpha 2 release, and Ruby 3.0.2.
        The gem Devise is used for authentication, with some tinkering (issue <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/pull/5397" target="_blank" class="text-dark hover:underline">#5397)</a>.

        TailwindCSS is used for the CSS, the main reason being that I work with it daily. Once I "got" the API, I have never been more productive when working with design implementation.
